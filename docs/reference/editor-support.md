# Editor support

It is possible to write Miking code in any editor and compile it
via the command line. There are, however, editing modes for a
number of editors:

- [Emacs](https://github.com/miking-lang/miking-emacs)
- [Vim](https://github.com/miking-lang/miking-vim)
- [Sublime](https://github.com/miking-lang/miking-sublime-text)

If you create an editing mode of your own, please send a pull
request to update this list!
